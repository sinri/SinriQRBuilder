# SinriQRBuilder

The Java implementation of [Ark-QRBuilder](https://github.com/sinri/Ark-QRBuilder).

Unlike the libraries like un-Maven-ed swetake or so, this project provides your source codes directly with GPLv3 License. 
You can simply embed the codes into your own projects, no need to run a local maven install command, maybe more friendly to `small & white`s.

Limitation: It could not be used for encode non-ASCII and non-ShiftJIS strings.
